BT-Active Discussions is a drop in module to output forums-style active discussions table on any page or post.

== Description ==

This is a recent comments plugin that displays customizable number of blog posts with recently updated comment. The output is very similar to phpBB's View Active Topics and vBulletin's Today's Posts functions.

You can see a demo at [Moolanomy Personal Finance Blog](http://www.moolanomy.com/recent-discussions/) and You can see a demo at [Blogthority](http://www.blogthority.com/recent-discussions/)
